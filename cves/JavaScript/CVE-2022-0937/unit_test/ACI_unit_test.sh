# Assuming the environment setup is required, you might need to start a server or prepare the environment
# For example, starting a local server that hosts the application vulnerable to the CVE
# Here we just comment it as a placeholder:
# echo "Starting the server..."
# ./start_server.sh

# Now, run the Python exploit script
echo "Running the exploit script..."
python ACI_unit_test.py

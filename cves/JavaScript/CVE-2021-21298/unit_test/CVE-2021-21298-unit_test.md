Now, there is a CVE in this repo:Node-Red is a low-code programming for event-driven applications built using nodejs. Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The issue has been patched in Node-RED 1.2.8. The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor..
Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/Project.js:Project.prototype.getFile()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/Project.js:Project.prototype.resolveMerge()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/Project.js:init()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/Project.js:init()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:createProject()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:deleteProject()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:init()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:init()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:loadProject()packages/node_modules/@node-red/runtime/lib/storage/localfilesystem/projects/index.js:loadProject().

Please write a CVE exploit script to try to exploit the CVE.
The unit test scripts should follow the logic of the CVE. If running the scripts can still exploit the CVE, the exploit succcess; otherwise, it fails.

Now, please write an exploit script with the path as ACI_unit_test.py.
To be noted, if the exploit passes, "print('The ACI exploit success!!!')", otherwise "print('The ACI exploit failed!!!')".

The logic of the script should follow that of the CVE exploit. You should know all the codes to realize the CVE exploit. That means I can directly run your script to judge whether the CVE can be exploited without modifying or adding code. You can add any files, like images or documents, that play as the payload in the CVE exploitation.

Furthermore, please write a shell script so I can use the shell script to auto-deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python ACI_unit_test.py". And name the shell script as ACI_unit_test.sh.
Before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. You should notice the Python version the repo uses.
Your shell scripts are executed in the repo dir directly, so you do not need to cd into it.

Some additional attention:
- Do not leave a placeholder for the script, but realize the code!!!
- Complete the whole script process, and do not leave any code like "pass" in Python to let me fill in. You should realize all the unit test logic.

Now, there is a CVE in this repo:semantic-release is an open source npm package for automated version management and package publishing. In affected versions secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by `encodeURI`. Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly..
Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:index.js:envCi().

Please write a CVE exploit script to try to exploit the CVE.
The unit test scripts should follow the logic of the CVE. If running the scripts can still exploit the CVE, the exploit succcess; otherwise, it fails.

Now, please write an exploit script with the path as ACI_unit_test.py.
To be noted, if the exploit passes, "print('The ACI exploit success!!!')", otherwise "print('The ACI exploit failed!!!')".

The logic of the script should follow that of the CVE exploit. You should know all the codes to realize the CVE exploit. That means I can directly run your script to judge whether the CVE can be exploited without modifying or adding code. You can add any files, like images or documents, that play as the payload in the CVE exploitation.

Furthermore, please write a shell script so I can use the shell script to auto-deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python ACI_unit_test.py". And name the shell script as ACI_unit_test.sh.
Before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. You should notice the Python version the repo uses.
Your shell scripts are executed in the repo dir directly, so you do not need to cd into it.

Some additional attention:
- Do not leave a placeholder for the script, but realize the code!!!
- Complete the whole script process, and do not leave any code like "pass" in Python to let me fill in. You should realize all the unit test logic.

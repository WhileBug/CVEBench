Now, there is a CVE in this repo:NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit..
Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:nltk/tokenize/punkt.py:_match_potential_end_contexts()nltk/tokenize/punkt.py:_slices_from_text()nltk/tokenize/punkt.py:_slices_from_text()nltk/tokenize/punkt.py:debug_decisions()nltk/tokenize/punkt.py:debug_decisions().

Now, I have fixed the CVE in some way, but I need a unit test script to determine whether my fix is successful.
The unit test scripts should follow the logic of the CVE. If running the scripts can still exploit the CVE, the unit test fails; otherwise, it passes.

Now, please write a unit test script with the path as with the unit test script path as ACI_unit_test.py.
To be noted, if the unit test passes, "print('The ACI unit test is passed!!!')", otherwise "print('The ACI unit test is failed!!!')".

Furthermore, please write a shell script so I can use the shell script to auto-deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python ACI_unit_test.py". And name the shell script as ACI_unit_test.sh.
Before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. You should notice the Python version the repo uses.
Your shell scripts are executed in the repo dir directly, so you do not need to cd into the repo dir.

P.S: Please do not leave a placeholder for the unit test, but realize the code!!!

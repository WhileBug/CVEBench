-==================
-What is SaltStack?
-==================
+#!/bin/bash
 
-Salt is a new approach to infrastructure management. Easy enough to get
-running in minutes, scalable enough to manage tens of thousands of servers,
-and fast enough to communicate with them in *seconds*.
+# Assuming the repository is a typical Python package and can be installed via pip
+# The Python version is not specified, so we will use the default 'python' command
 
-Salt delivers a dynamic communication bus for infrastructures that can be used
-for orchestration, remote execution, configuration management and much more.
+# Install the repository package
+pip install .

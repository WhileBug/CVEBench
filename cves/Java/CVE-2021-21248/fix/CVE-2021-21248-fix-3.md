            Now there is a CVE in this repo:OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint parameters. InputSpec is used to define parameters of a Build spec. It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input..
            Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/textinput/TextInput.java:TextInput::getPropertyDef();server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/textinput/TextInput.java:TextInput::getPropertyDef();server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/InputSpec.java:InputSpec::escape();server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/model/support/inputspec/InputSpec.java:InputSpec::escape();

            Now there is a CVE in this repo:OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is an issue involving YAML parsing which can lead to post-auth remote code execution. In order to parse and process YAML files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which by default (when not using `SafeConstructor`) allows the instantiation of arbitrary classes. We can leverage that to run arbitrary code by instantiating classes such as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader` to load the script engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a user controlled class. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing certain known classes to be deserialized.
            Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/migration/VersionedYamlDoc.java:VersionedYamlDoc::OneConstructor::getClassForNode();server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/migration/VersionedYamlDoc.java:VersionedYamlDoc::OneConstructor::getClassForNode();server-core/src/main/java/io/onedev/server/migration/VersionedYamlDoc.java:VersionedYamlDoc::toBean();

Now, there is a CVE in this repo:Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour - to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED = False` in the Django settings file..
Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:wagtail/admin/views/pages/edit.py:send_commenting_notifications()wagtail/admin/views/pages/edit.py:send_commenting_notifications()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:assertNeverEmailedWrongUser()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:setUp()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:test_delete_comment()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:test_new_comment()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:test_new_reply()wagtail/admin/tests/pages/test_edit_page.py:test_resolve_comment().

Now, I have fixed the CVE in some way, but I need a unit test script to determine whether my fix is successful.
The unit test scripts should follow the logic of the CVE. If running the scripts can still exploit the CVE, the unit test fails; otherwise, it passes.

Now, please write a unit test script with the path as with the unit test script path as ACI_unit_test.py.
To be noted, if the unit test passes, "print('The ACI unit test is passed!!!')", otherwise "print('The ACI unit test is failed!!!')".

Furthermore, please write a shell script so I can use the shell script to auto-deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python ACI_unit_test.py". And name the shell script as ACI_unit_test.sh.
Before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. You should notice the Python version the repo uses.
Your shell scripts are executed in the repo dir directly, so you do not need to cd into the repo dir.

P.S: Please do not leave a placeholder for the unit test, but realize the code!!!

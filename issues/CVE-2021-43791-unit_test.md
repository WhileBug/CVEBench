Now, there is a CVE in this repo:Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible..
Now the following functions is the cause for the CVE:zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_expired()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_expired()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_key_of_wrong_type()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_key_of_wrong_type()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_obj_not_exist_error()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_confirmation_obj_not_exist_error()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_register()zerver/tests/test_signup.py:test_register()zerver/views/registration.py:check_prereg_key()zerver/views/registration.py:check_prereg_key_and_redirect()zerver/views/registration.py:get_prereg_key_and_redirect().

Now, I have fixed the CVE in some way, but I need a unit test script to determine whether my fix is successful.
The unit test scripts should follow the logic of the CVE. If running the scripts can still exploit the CVE, the unit test fails; otherwise, it passes.

Now, please write a unit test script with the path as with the unit test script path as ACI_unit_test.py.
To be noted, if the unit test passes, "print('The ACI unit test is passed!!!')", otherwise "print('The ACI unit test is failed!!!')".

Furthermore, please write a shell script so I can use the shell script to auto-deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python ACI_unit_test.py". And name the shell script as ACI_unit_test.sh.
Before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. You should notice the Python version the repo uses.
Your shell scripts are executed in the repo dir directly, so you do not need to cd into the repo dir.

P.S: Please do not leave a placeholder for the unit test, but realize the code!!!

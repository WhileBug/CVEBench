Now there is a CVE in this repo:{cve_description}.
{cve_changes_description}.
Now I have fixed the CVE, but I need a unit test script to test my fix.
Please create a unit test script for the CVE with the unit test script path as {unit_test_filename}.
To be noted, if the unit test pass, "print('The ACI unit test is passed!!!')", else, "print('The ACI unit test is failed!!!')".
Furthermore, please write an shell script for I can use the shell script to auto deploy the environment for the repo and to run the unit test script as "python {unit_test_filename}". And name the shell script as {shell_filename}.
To be noted, before you write the shell script, please carefully review the repo's ReadMe about how to install and deploy the repo. And you should notice the python version the repo use.
And your shell scripts is executed in the repo dir directly. So you do not need to cd into the repo dir.
